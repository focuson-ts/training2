### Nice to know
    Modal page is ultimately a page, but it is triggered 
    by a button ( modal button ),
    
    Whenever we want to edit a pages state, we must use a "temp"
    value, so that we don't manually alter the "fromApi" state. That "temp"
    state is going to be sent as payload to the api on commit.

    The compiler helps you a lot, you can also ctrl+click on different keys to see
    their type and possible values.
